# 17/03/23 Ramiflix üçøüé¨

In this exercise my task was to build a React application which will let me load data from a locally-hosted API and submit new entries to it. The back-end was provided, my job was to build the front end.

The Movie Database API is a powerful RESTful web API that provides developers access to an extensive collection of movie and TV show data. With over 4 million titles and detailed information including cast, crew, reviews, and ratings, it's an ideal tool for building applications related to entertainment. The API is easy to use and provides various endpoints that allow developers to retrieve specific movie or TV show details, search for titles, discover popular titles, and much more. It's a great resource for any developer looking to build a movie or TV-related application especially for <b> Ramiflix. </b>
