# 17/03/23 Ramiflix 🍿🎬

In this exercise my task was to build a React application which will let me load data from a locally-hosted API and submit new entries to it. The back-end was provided, my job was to build the front end.

## API

The Movie Database API was used for this project: `https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/`

The Movie Database API is a powerful RESTful web API that provides developers access to an extensive collection of movie and TV show data. With over 4 million titles and detailed information including cast, crew, reviews, and ratings, it was an ideal tool for building Ramiflix. 

The API provides various endpoints that allow developers to retrieve specific movie or TV show details, search for titles, discover popular titles, and much more. It's a great resource for anyone looking to build a movie or TV-related application especially for <b> Ramiflix. </b> 🎥

## Diagrams 🎨

The first diagram illustrates the user's initial view of the React application

The initial interface of  Ramiflix is composed of a landing page, a banner, and a dynamically refreshing list of different shows that are fetched from the API. The Ramiflix logo and user avatar are located in the corners of the page, while two buttons labeled "Play" and "My List" can also be found in the banner.

The second diagram provides a depiction of the user's perspective as they utilize the React application by scrolling down. As they traverse the page, various categories, such as "Popular", "Trending Now", and "Top Rated", are dynamically fetched from The Movie Database API and displayed to the user in a visually appealing manner. The seamless integration of API data into the application's front-end allows for a fluid and interactive user experience.

Finally, the third diagram depicts the user's view upon refreshing the React application. Upon each refresh, the banner dynamically updates to display different shows fetched from the API, providing users with an ever-changing experience. Additionally, the banner also auto-rotates every few seconds, further enhancing the user experience.
