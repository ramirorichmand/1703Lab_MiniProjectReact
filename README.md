In this exercise your task is to build a React application which will let you load data from a locally-hosted API and submit new entries to it. The back-end will be provided for you, your job will be to build the front end.

The API provides a list of pets and routes to see the the entire list and add a new pet. Your application should have separate components to view the list and let the user add a new pet.
